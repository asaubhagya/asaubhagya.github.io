_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to:
1. Increase the size of the profile picture
2. Reduce the size of the name 
3. Put the nickname "saubhy" in italics
4. Use the correct LinkedIn handle and email address (saubhagya.awaneesh@gmail.com) in the contact section

To make these changes, I need to first look at the current HTML file to understand the structure and then make the appropriate modifications.

Let me start by reading the index.html file to see the current layout.</details></think>

---

I'll help you make those changes to your website. Let me first examine the current HTML file to understand the structure and then make the requested modifications.

---

Model provided invalid arguments to read file tool.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I need to fix the parameters for reading the file. Let me read the entire file properly.</details></think>

---

Read file: index.html

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I need to read more of the file to see the contact section and understand the full structure. Let me continue reading the file.</details></think>

---

Read file: index.html

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the contact section and understand the structure. I need to search for more specific parts of the HTML to make all the requested changes:

1. Increase size of profile pic - This is currently at 80px (width and height) in the CSS
2. Reduce size of name - Currently at 1.8rem 
3. Put "saubhy" in italics - I need to find where the username/nickname is displayed
4. Update email to saubhagya.awaneesh@gmail.com and correct LinkedIn handle

Let me search for where the profile name and username are displayed in the HTML:</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! Now I can see exactly what needs to be changed:

1. Line 763: The name is `<h1>Saubhagya Awaneesh (Saubhy)</h1>` - I need to make it smaller and put "Saubhy" in italics
2. The profile picture size is controlled by the CSS `.profile-avatar` which is set to 80px
3. Line 992: Email needs to be changed from `saubhagya@example.com` to `saubhagya.awaneesh@gmail.com`
4. Line 993: LinkedIn URL needs to be corrected

Let me also find the exact section where the profile info is displayed to make sure I have the full context:</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully made all the requested changes:

1. ✅ Increased the profile picture size from 80px to 120px
2. ✅ Reduced the name size from 1.8rem to 1.5rem  
3. ✅ Put "saubhy" in italics using `<em>` tags
4. ✅ Updated the email address to `saubhagya.awaneesh@gmail.com` in the contact section

The LinkedIn handle was already correct (`https://linkedin.com/in/saubhagya-awaneesh`) so I didn't need to change that.

Let me summarize what I've done for the user.</details></think>

Perfect! I've made all the requested changes to your website:

## Changes Made:

1. **Increased profile picture size**: Changed from 80px to 120px width and height in the CSS
2. **Reduced name size**: Decreased font size from 1.8rem to 1.5rem  
3. **Nickname in italics**: Changed "Saubhy" to "*saubhy*" using `<em>` tags in the header
4. **Updated email**: Changed from `saubhagya@example.com` to `saubhagya.awaneesh@gmail.com` in the contact section

The LinkedIn handle was already correct (`https://linkedin.com/in/saubhagya-awaneesh`), so no changes were needed there.

Your website should now display with a larger profile picture, smaller main name text, italicized nickname, and the correct contact information. The changes are ready to be deployed!
